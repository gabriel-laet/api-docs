# Environments

 In order to perform operations against Loggi API, you will first need to setup a configuration management in your application to support switching between our sandbox (for tests) and production (real world) environments.

## Sandbox environment

Is maintained for development and test purposes. You can use free of charge (because the service is not real) but, pay attention to details bellow:

 - no e-mails will be send.

## Production environment

The real deal; all operations will be charged and service will be executed following the [terms of use](/help/terms-of-use).
